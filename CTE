The CTE (Common Table Expression) will help us figure out the average amount paid to customers

WITH average_amount_paid_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, SUM) AS

(SELECT A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city, SUM(A.amount) 
FROM payment A 
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = c.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule', 
			   'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celeya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
ORDER BY SUM DESC
LIMIT 5) 
SELECT AVG(SUM)
FROM average_amount_paid_cte
