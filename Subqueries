The Subquery below will help us figure out how many of the top five customers are based within each country

SELECT E.country AS country, COUNT(DISTINCT B.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, 
COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer B
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
LEFT JOIN 

(SELECT A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city, SUM(A.amount) 
FROM payment A 
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id 
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = c.address_id 
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id 
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id 
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule', 'Kurashiki', 
			   'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celeya', 'So Leopoldo') 
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city 
ORDER BY SUM DESC) AS top_5_customers

ON E.country = top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY E.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10
